###League Rules###

**Overview:**

Chicago Dynasty Football (CDF) is a 12-team fantasy football dynasty
league, with 40 man rosters where most players are kept year to year,
individual defensive players, annual rookie drafts, and free agent
auctions. CDF is a year-round league, with three distinct phases:
Preseason, In-Season, and Offseason. The inaugural season (2009) will
follow different rules than subsequent seasons, please see Inaugural
Season section.


**In Season:**

-	There will be 12 teams separated into two 6-team divisions.
-	Each team plays everyone in its division twice (5 teams x2 = 10
games), and half of the teams in the other division once (3 teams x1 = 3
games), for a total of 13 regular season games from NFL Week 1-Week 13.
-	The CDF playoffs are from NFL Week 14-Week 16.  The first round is
during NFL Week 14, with the second best team in each division playing
the third best team.  The best team in each division has a bye week in
the first round.  Seeding is determined by record, with total points as
a tiebreaker.  The winners of the first round games will play the
respective first seeds in the division championships (second round) in
NFL Week 15.  The two division championship winners will face off in the
CDF Super Bowl in NFL Week 16.

**Free Agency Auctions:**

-	Free agents (FA) are acquired via open auction, in three Free Agency
phases: Offseason Free Agency, Preseason Free Agency, and In-Season Free
Agency.  The below rules apply to each of the three Free Agency phases,
with each phase also having its unique rules.
-	There are 70 FA dollars (FA$) per year allocated to each team.  Each
team receives 30 FA$ after the NFL season is over for Offseason Free
Agency, 20 FA$ after the rookie draft for Preseason Free Agency, and 20
FA$ right before the season begins for In-Season Free Agency.  FA dollars do
not have to be used in the Free Agency phase they are received, and any
amount of FA$ can be used in any phase.  FA dollars can be traded in any
quantity.
-	Each team may carryover a maximum of 75 FA$ from one phase to the next
(Offseason to Preseason, Preseason to In-Season, In Season to
Offseason).  At the start of any phase, each team may have a maximum of
75 FA$, before the FA dollars for that phase are received.
-	Free agents are bid on in an open auction format, with a minimum
starting bid of $1.
-	The minimum bid increment is $1 when the current bid is less than $5;
once the current bid reaches $5 or higher, the minimum bid increment is
$2.
-	Any bid must be possible within the owner’s FA$ budget, in that the
sum of outstanding winning bids + bid that is made must not exceed the
owner’s FA$ total.
-	The owner that wins an FA auction has the player added to his roster,
and must have a legal roster (within the current roster limits) after
the player is added, with an accompanying legal drop if necessary.  An
owner cannot add a player, and then drop the player immediately, if the
addition would cause the owner to go over the roster limit.
-	There is no limit to the number of active bids, winning bids, or
players won by an owner, as long as they are within the constraints
outlined previously.
-	The FA auction winner has the winning amount deducted from his FA$
budget.
-	Once a player is acquired through auction, the auction price is no
longer associated with the player in any way.  If he is traded, the
owner acquiring him does not have to pay the auction price, and if he is
dropped and bid on again, the minimum starting bid is still $1.
-	Bids will be made through Google Groups.
-	Bid timing is based off of the time the email was received in the
Google Group.  If there is any reasonable doubt about whether the bid
was on time, the bid is null and void.
-	FA$ balances will be tracked and updated through a Google spreadsheet.
-	The exact start and deadline dates for all Free Agency phases will be
set during the season.
- Injury Exception vote:
	- An owner may call an injury exception vote while he is winning or has won a player auction, and the value of the player changed substantially while the owner was winning the auction or after the auction concluded (example: Nate Burleson injury during 2013 season).  The value change would most commonly be due to injury but may be caused by other off the field events; it is at the discretion of the owner to call an injury exception vote as he sees fit.
	- The owner must email the league and bring up that he is calling for an injury exception vote for an auction, and must get half of the league (6+ owners) other than himself to agree to waive the auction.  The owner must get the necessary votes by the next Sunday kickoff, or 7 days after calling the vote if during the offseason or preseason.
	- If the vote passes, the player goes back to the free agent pool and may be bid on in subsequent auctions, and the owner has the FA$ credited back to his balance.
	- If the vote does not pass, the auction is processed as usual; the player is added to the roster of the owner and the FA$ is deducted from his balance.

 **Offseason Free Agency:**

-	All teams must make roster cuts to the offseason roster limit of 30
players.  The deadline for making these cuts will be approximately a
month after the NFL Super Bowl.
-	Each team can designate up to 2 Restricted Free Agents (RFA) and 8
Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA).
-	There are about four weeks of Free Agent auctions, during late-March to
mid-April.  During this time, roster limits expand to 46 players.  Any
NFL players are eligible to be bid on (players on NFL rosters, or that
have previously played in the NFL – amateur players are not eligible),
not just players designated as UFA or RFA.
-	For Restricted Free Agents, the original owner cannot participate in
the auction.  However, after the auction is over, the original owner has
72 hours to declare that he is keeping the player for the final bid
(must spend that amount in FA$).  If he declines to do so, the winning
bidder will win that player, and the original owner will get half of the
final FA$ bid (rounded down) added to his FA dollar budget, after the
conclusion of Offseason Free Agency.  The winning bidder is allowed to
raise his final bid within 24 hours of winning the player, to deter the
original owner from re-signing the player.
-	While the RFA process is ongoing, the winning owner’s FA$ are
considered to be part of a winning bid (and may not be spent on other
auctions or in trades) until the RFA auction is resolved.
-	Any RFAs that are not bid on in Offseason Free Agency may be retained
by the original owner at no cost.
-	For Unrestricted Free Agents, the original owner can bid on these
players along with other owners.  There is no advantage given to the
original owner.
-	An auction is active for the 48 hours following the most recent bid. 
After 48 hours have elapsed since the most recent bid, the player is won
by the owner with the last bid, for the amount that was bid.
-	There will only be an opening bid deadline for Offseason Free Agency. 
After that deadline is passed, no more auctions may be opened.  All
active auctions will continue until there has not been a bid in the
auction for the last 48 hours.
-	After the conclusion of all Offseason auctions, RFA FA$ are added to
each owner’s FA$ balance.

  
 **Rookie Draft:**

-	The yearly rookie draft will take place during May and early June. 
Only rookies may be drafted; other non-rookie players can be acquired
via auctions during Preseason Free Agency.
-	Rookies picked in the NFL Supplemental Draft in July are treated as
regular free agents and may be added in preseason free agency, as the
NFL Supplemental Draft will normally occur after the CDF rookie draft.
-	Draft order for nonplayoff teams will be determined using a lottery
system, with worse teams having a higher chance of getting the top
pick.  The first 6 picks of each round will be the nonplayoff teams from
the previous season, the last 6 picks of each round will be the playoff
teams from the previous season.
-	The reverse Week 10 standings (standings after Week 10) from the
previous season for nonplayoff teams will be used for the rookie
lottery.  The rookie lottery will be conducted before the Offseason
begins, during early February.
-	The last 6 picks of each round will be reverse order of playoff finish,
with ties (teams eliminated in the same round) broken by regular season
finish (record first, then total points).
-	The draft order will be the same first to last order each round; it
will not be a serpentine format.  The owner that picks first in the
first round will do the same for the second round and all remaining
rounds.
-	The draft will be 6 rounds.
-	Each owner will have 24 hours to make his selection.  If it is unlikely
that you will be able to make your selection during this timeframe,
please send a proxy pick (your top several selections) to another owner
that will be around when your pick comes up.  An alternative is having
one of the other owners call you when your pick is up, and making a
proxy pick at that time.
-	If a pick is not made within the 24 hour deadline, the pick will be
forfeited, and cannot be made after the next owner has picked.  This
rule will be exercised at the commissioner’s discretion; first round
picks especially will not be passed unless there is a long delay and no
response from multiple attempts to contact an owner.
-	An owner may pass if he does not want to make his pick.  Once a pick
has been passed, it is forfeited.
-There will not be a rookie draft during the inaugural season (2009). 
All rookies are eligible to be drafted in the Inaugural Draft.
-	All teams must adhere to the 46 player preseason roster limit.  Any
pick or any other acquisition must result in a legal roster; if the pick
causes the team to go over the 46 player limit, an accompanying legal
drop must be made.  An owner cannot make a pick, and then drop the pick
immediately, if that pick would cause the owner to go over the roster
limit..
-	The rookie draft will be done over the Google Group, and tracked on a
Google Spreadsheet.

  

**Preseason Free Agency:**

-	Preseason Free Agency takes place during the NFL training camp and
preseason (August).
-	Any non-amateur players may be bid on, including rookies.
-	An auction is active for the 48 hours following the most recent bid. 
After 48 hours have elapsed since the most recent bid, the player is won
by the owner with the last bid, for the amount that was bid.
-	The deadline for opening bids will be set at the beginning of the
Preseason Free Agency period.
-	There will only be an opening bid deadline for Preseason Free Agency. 
After that deadline is passed, no more auctions may be opened.  All
active auctions will continue until there has not been a bid in the
auction for the last 48 hours.
-	After the conclusion of Preseason Free Agency (approximately one week
before the NFL regular season begins), all teams must cut down to the 40
player in-season roster limit.

  

**In-Season Free Agency:**

-	Starting at Sunday kickoff (12 PM CST), any NFL player not already on a
roster can be bid on.
-	Only NFL players are eligible to be bid on (players on NFL rosters or
that have previously played in the NFL – amateur players are not
eligible).
-	Players dropped in the current week by any team, may not be bid on
until the next week of free agency.  For example, if an owner adds Matt
Forte in free agency and drops Jay Cutler to open up the roster space,
Jay Cutler may not be bid on as a free agent until the next week of free
agency.
-	There are two deadlines each week, the opening bid deadline, and all
bid deadline.  The opening bid deadline is the last time an owner can
open an auction on a free agent (any free agent that hasn’t been bid on
yet).  The all bid deadline is the last time an owner can bid on any
currently open auction (any free agent for who an auction has already
been opened).  These deadlines depend on the date of the first game of
the NFL week:
	-   weeks with games starting Thursday night:
		-	Tuesday 11:59 PM CST opening bids
		-	Wednesday 8:00 PM CST all bids
	-   weeks with games starting Sunday noon:
       	-	Thursday 11:59 PM CST opening bids
    	-	Saturday 12:00 PM CST all bids
-	If a player is bid on within the last hour before the all bid deadline
(Wednesday 7:00 PM-8:00 PM CST on weeks with games starting Thursday
night, Saturday 11:00 PM-12:00 PM CST on weeks with games starting
Sunday noon), the bid deadline is extended 30 minutes.  If there is a
bid within the 30 minute extension, the bid deadline is extended another
30 minutes, until there are no bids within the last 30 minutes.
-Any open auction that has not been bid on in the last 24 hours is won
by the last owner who made a bid for that auction.  This is the
“anti-sniping” rule.
-	Bidding example (for a week with games starting Thursday night, all
times are CST):
	-   Joe open bids on Matt Forte for $1 on Monday at 6:00 PM (if no bids on Forte by Tuesday 6:00 PM, Joe wins Forte for $1).
	-   Mike bids on Matt Forte for $2 on Tuesday at 2:00 PM.
	-   Joe bids on Matt Forte for $3 on Wednesday at 10:52 AM.
	-   Mike bids on Matt Forte for $4 on Wednesday at 7:15 PM.  Since the bid is within the last hour of bidding, the bid deadline is extended 30 minutes to 8:30 PM.
	-   Joe bids on Matt Forte for $5 on Wednesday at 7:48 PM.  The bid deadline is still 8:30 PM.
	-   Mike bids on Matt Forte for $7 (since the bid has reached $5, the minimum bid increment is now $2) on Wednesday at 8:17 PM.  Since the bid is within the 30 minute extension, the bid deadline is extended another 30 minutes, to 9:00 PM.
	-   Joe bids on Matt Forte for $9 on Wednesday at 8:28 PM.  The bid deadline is still 9:00 PM.
	-   No more bids by 9:00 PM.  Joe wins Matt Forte for $9.
- Players must be added on the hosting site (with a corresponding drop/trade, if applicable), by Sunday kickoff.
	- Players playing on earlier than Sunday kickoff (e.g. Thursday night) may be added after their game has started.  However, a player being dropped/traded to free up a roster slot may not be dropped/traded after their game has started.
- If a player that was won as a free agent is not added on the hosting site by Sunday kickoff, we will use the following rule (the "late add" rule):
	- For each player that was not added (that would make the owner go over the roster limit), add the player and drop the lowest MyFantasyLeague percentage owned non-starting active roster (not on IR or PS) player on the same side of the ball (offensive players - including kickers, or defensive players).  The ownership percentage for the specific week will be used.
	- MyFantasyLeague percentage owned can be viewed by going to a MFL league site and going to Reports -> Player -> Top Adds/Drops/Starters, then selecting Owned, Any Status, the position, and the week.

**Roster Limits:**

-	The in-season roster limit is 40 players, with 2 IR players and 2 PS players.
  This is the period from the end of preseason (late August), to the start of the offseason (early March).
-	The offseason roster limit is 30 players, with 2 PS players (no IR players), until Offseason Free Agency begins.
  This is the period from when RFAs and UFAs are designated (early March) until Offseason Free Agency auctions begin (late March). 
- After Offseason Free Agency auctions begin, the roster limit goes up to 46 players, and there is no separate PS.  However, players that
  were previously on the PS going in to the offseason may still be added to the PS for the next season.
- The 46 player limit continues through the rookie draft (May-early June) and Preseason Free Agency (late July-mid August).
-	After the conclusion of the preseason (late August), right before the season begins, the rosters go back down to the 40 player in-season limit, with 2 IR players and 2 PS players.

  

**Injured Reserve (IR):**

- Two IR roster slots were added starting in the 2012 season.  Players occupying
  these IR slots do not count against the in-season roster limit.
- IR slot eligibility is based on the hosting site.
	- For Fantrax (as of the 2013 season), players on PUP (injured during preseason
  and out for first 6 weeks of season or temporary IR (IR designated for return)
  are eligible for the IR slot.  They will continue to be eligible as long as it is
  allowed by Fantrax.
- For players on PUP or temporary IR/designated for return, they must be moved to
  active roster (with a corresponding drop/trade if at the roster limit) when being
  activated from the PUP or IR.
- There is no restriction on position of players that are in the IR slot.
- IR players may be dropped directly from IR, they do not need to be activated
  first.
- IR begins at the start of the regular season.  When cutting down rosters
  to the in-season limit of 40 players, you can designate up to 2 additional players
  (that are eligible) to start the season in your IR slots.
- IR ends after the regular season: After the season is over, you no longer have IR slots,
  and you need to cut down to the regular 30 players + 2 RFAs.
- Drops: IR players may be dropped directly from IR, do not need to activate first.
- Trades: IR players may not be traded directly from IR, they must be activated first
  (with corresponding drop/IR deactivation from active roster).
- Adding an IR-eligible player as a free agent: When you add an IR-eligible player,
  he has to be added to active roster first (with a corresponding drop/trade if at the
  roster limit), then moved to IR.

**Practice Squad (PS):**

- Two PS roster slots were added starting in the 2013 season.  Players occupying
  these PS slots do not count against the in-season roster limit.
- The PS players are declared at the start of the season, along with IR players and cuts down to 40 man active roster.
- To be eligible for the PS, the player must be a rookie drafted in the most recent CDF rookie draft
  (may not be a rookie added in preseason free agency) that was declared for PS at the start of the season,
  or a player that was previously on the PS (was a rookie in previous years that was never activated from the PS).
- PS players may not be added to the starting lineup.
- PS players may be activated by moving them to the active roster (with a corresponding drop/trade if
  at the roster limit).  After being activated, the PS player may be added to the starting lineup.
- Once activated, a player previously on the PS may not be moved back to the PS.
- Traded PS players may remain on PS (as long as within 2 man limit) or they may be activated without adding to PS first
- PS players must be moved to 40-man active roster first before being moved to IR.
- PS players are separate from the normal offseason roster limits - going in to the offseason, there is the usual 30 man
  roster, 2 RFA, 8-10 UFA, and 2 man PS.
- When rosters expand during the offseason to 46 players, PS players are included in the 46 man roster limit, there is no separate PS.
  However, players that were previously on the PS going in to the offseason may still be added to the PS for the next season.
- PS players are tracked on Fantrax as minor league slots.
- When activating a PS player during the season, the owner must send an email to the league to indicate that he is activating
  the player.

**Trading:**

-	Players, FA$ (in any quantity, but must be currently owned,
cannot be FA$ received in the future), and picks (from the two
upcoming or current rookie drafts) are the only assets that may be
traded.
-	Trades are allowed at any time during the season, except during the CDF
playoffs (NFL Weeks 14-16).  The In-Season trade deadline is right
before rosters lock for the CDF playoffs (NFL Week 14).
-	Trades must be announced over the Google group, with a confirmation by
the other owner(s) involved.
-	Incentive clauses, players to be named later, temporary trades,
multi-part trades (one part of the trade executed at a later time than
another part of the trade), and agreements (not bidding on a certain
player, benching starters against someone) are not allowed.  Multi-party
trades are allowed (trades involving more than one team).
-	The rules for adding a player via trade are the same as adding a player
via FA auction.  The owner must have a legal roster (within the current
roster limits) after the player is added, with an accompanying legal
drop if necessary.  An owner cannot add a player, and then drop the
player immediately, if the addition would cause the owner to go over the
current roster limit.
-	Draft picks may be traded for the next two upcoming or current rookie
drafts.  Examples:
	-   Before and during the 2010 rookie draft, only picks from 2010 and 2011 may be traded.
	-   After the conclusion of the 2010 rookie draft, only picks from 2011 and 2012 may be traded.
-	Collusion is not allowed.  Since this is a dynasty league with a lot of
future considerations involved in trades, evaluating trade equality is
not as simple as in a redraft league.  There will be no league voting
for approving or vetoing trades; any trade veto is at the discretion of
the commissioner.  Since everyone in this league is a personal friend of
at least one other person in this league, there is a trust that everyone
will compete with their team’s best interests in mind.  There will
generally be no trade restrictions other than what is listed above, but
if there is a repeat offender as far as lopsided looking trades, that
owner’s membership in the league will be evaluated at the end of the
season (or in-season, if the trades are disrupting the competitive
balance of the league).

  

**In-season Roster Management and Lineups:**

- Once a player’s game has started, he cannot be involved in a transaction (drop, trade or IR) for that week.  This will cover these scenarios:
	- Dropping for a free agent add or trade that week
	- Trading a player playing on Thursday for a player playing on Sunday, and getting both of their stats (or trading a player playing the early Sunday games for a player playing on Monday night, etc).  If these trades are decided on prior between the games of the involved players, they should be executed for the next week.
	- Moving to IR to activate a player from IR/PS or to add a player (very unlikely, but still should be covered)
- Penalty for starting a LB (who is not eligible at DL/DB) in IDP flex slot (which is DL or DB only) is an automatic 0 for that player.  This is currently possible to do in Fantrax, which only uses a generic IDP flex slot and not a DL/DB flex slot.

**Administrative:**

-	CDF will use a Google Group for all league communication.  This group
will be created when the league starts and all owners must be subscribed
to the group.  Draft picks, trades, auction bids, and other league
announcements will be made through the group.
-	The website we use to run the league will be voted on and determined
before the start of the inaugural season.  We may use a different site
from year to year.
-	CDF is a free league; there is no entry fee or prize pool involved.
-	In the event of a 2011 NFL lockout, where there is no NFL season or
mostly replacement players are used, there will be no 2011 CDF season,
with all 2011 events (rookie draft, IDP expansion, free agency, etc)
postponed to 2012, and the 2012 rookie draft postponed to 2013.  All
future rookie draft picks will remain intact, and all trades of future
rookie draft picks will continue to be valid.

  

**Rules Changes:**

-	Prior to the Inaugural Draft, the league rules will be discussed and
changes possibly voted on based on the majority league opinion.  Once
the final rules are decided on, the Inaugural Draft will begin.
-	There may be future rules changes after we all get the hang of dynasty
play.  These rules changes will be discussed and voted on at the
beginning of the Offseason phase, shortly after the CDF Super Bowl. 
Possible future rules changes that may come up include roster limits,
auction rules, scoring, division re-seeding, and league expansion.
-	It is at the commissioner’s discretion as to whether a vote is needed,
and what kind of vote is needed (unanimous, majority) for a rules change
to take place.  Major rules changes that would have affected previous
picks/moves/trades (such as scoring) will only be implemented with
unanimous approval.  Other major rules changes (such as IDP expansion)
will usually not go into effect for at least a year after they are
specified, to allow time for research or adjusting strategy.

  

**Replacement Owners:**

-	If an owner wants to quit the league, ownership of his team will be
transferred to a replacement owner during the Offseason phase if
possible.
-	An owner may be forced to quit the league at the commissioner’s
discretion; this would only be in extreme cases of repeated collusive
trading, inactivity, or other actions that severely disrupt the
competitive balance of the league.  In this case, a replacement owner
would be found for his team.
-	Replacement owners will preferably come from friends of owners in the
league.

**Rules archive:**

-   Below rules sections are for rules that were needed at some point in
the history of CDF but are not currently used.

  

**Inaugural Season (2009):**

-   The Inaugural Season will be in 2009.  The Inaugural Season will follow
different rules than subsequent seasons, outlined below.
-   There will be an Inaugural Draft of 24 rounds, where all NFL players
(non-amateur) are eligible to be drafted, including rookies.  The draft
will be a serpentine (first-to-last, last-to-first) format.
-   The Inaugural Draft will take place from early-mid July 2009 to early
August 2009, and take place over email (Google Group).
-   Draft order will be determined by a random draw before the draft.
-   Picks may be traded, as well as picks for the 2010 rookie draft, but
not for the 2011 rookie draft.  Since no teams will have FA$ yet,
the only assets that may be traded during the draft are players and
picks.
-   The in-season 24 man roster limit will be in effect.
-   Each owner will have 12 hours to make his selection.  If it is unlikely
that you will be able to make your selection during this timeframe,
please send a proxy pick (your top several selections) to one of the
owners coming up after your pick (of course, verify that they will
probably be around when your pick comes up).  Send the proxy pick in an
attached word document so that it doesn’t show up in an email preview. 
An alternative is having one of the other owners call you when your pick
is up.
-   If a pick is not made within the 12 hour deadline, the pick will be
forfeited, and cannot be made after the next owner has picked.  This
rule will be exercised at the commissioner’s discretion; early round
picks especially will not be passed unless there is a long delay and no
response from multiple attempts to contact an owner.
-   There will be no Preseason Free Agency phase.
-   In-Season Free Agency will occur as usual, with all owners receiving 25
FA$ at the beginning of the NFL season, and another 25 FA dollars
after week 6.  Free agents may be bid on starting the week prior to NFL
Week 1.
-   The two divisions will be randomly seeded.

  

**2011 IDP Expansion:**

-   As agreed upon during the 2010 offseason, rosters will expand during
the 2011 offseason to accommodate Individual Defensive Players (IDP)
during the 2011 season.
-   Rules and changes for the IDP expansion are detailed in this section. 
All rules sections affected by the IDP expansion will be updated during
the 2011 offseason.  In the event of a 2011 NFL lockout, where there is
no NFL season or mostly replacement players are used, IDP expansion will
be delayed to 2012..
-   8 IDP starters will be added: 2 DL (DT/DE), 3 LB (OLB/MLB), 2 DB
(CB/S), 1 DL/D.
-   IDP scoring system: 1 pt/solo tackle, .5 pt/assisted tackle, 3
pts/sack (half sacks are credited 1.5 pts), 1 pt/pass defensed, 3
pts/forced fumble, 3 pts/fumble recovery, 4 pts/interception, 2
pts/blocked kick (FG/XP) or punt, 2 pts/safety, 6 pts/touchdown, all
IDPs will be eligible for any offensive/return stats also (if Yahoo
allows.
-   Team Defense will be kept and continue to be a starting position.
-Roster limits change from 24 in-season/18 before offseason free
agency/30 during offseason and preseason, to 40 in-season/30 before
offseason free agency/46 during offseason and preseason.
-   Because there are 10 offseason cuts now, free agency designations are
now 2 RFA and 8 UFA (10 total).
-   Rookie draft expands to 6 rounds.  IDP players may be drafted in the
rookie draft.
-   Initial IDP draft will be during the 2011 offseason, after 2011
offseason free agency and before the 2011 CDF rookie draft.  All
non-rookie IDP players will be eligible for the IDP draft, and only IDPs
may be drafted.  The IDP draft will be a 14 round serpentine draft, with
order randomly determined.  Picks in the IDP draft may be traded before
and during the draft.
-   IDPs may be acquired via free agency and traded as usual, after the
start of the initial IDP draft.  There are no restrictions as to how few
or how many IDPs you have on your roster.
-   FA$ allotment and bidding rules will remain the same.
